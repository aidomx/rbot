# Workspace

A workspace groups multiple rbot projects under one top-level Buildfile.

## Initialization

```bash
rbot init -w
```

## Basic form

A minimal workspace only lists its projects:

```text
use workspace

projects = app, tool
```

Each project follows the standard project convention (see
[Buildfile](buildfile.md)): a folder `<name>/` under the workspace root
containing `src/` and optionally `include/`. The projects need no
Buildfile of their own — rbot synthesizes one per project from the
workspace settings, with the binary named after the project. Common
settings (`flags`, `std`, ...) declared at the workspace level apply to
every project.

Non-standard projects stay free: declare per-project settings explicitly
in the workspace file.

```text
projects.rupamod as mod
projects.rupa as rupa
projects.ruka as ruka
```

A workspace can define common compiler settings and project-specific settings.

## Root and output locations

Every project builds with the project folder as its working directory, so
`root` is a **per-project** setting. A workspace-level `root = .` is
**ignored with a warning** — it does not aggregate outputs into the
workspace folder. Each project writes its own `bin/`, `lib/`, `build/`
inside its folder.

To aggregate outputs at the workspace root, point each project's output
folders there with relative paths (`..` = workspace root):

```text
app.output.binaryDir = ../bin
app.output.libDir = ../lib
mod.archive.dir = ../modules
```

Packaging (archive) projects such as `mod` above run once during the
library phase and are skipped in the binary phase
(`skip: selesai di fase library`) — their artifacts (archives, packages)
are produced there and are not rebuilt.

## Build commands

```bash
rbot -w
```

Build all projects in the workspace.

```bash
rbot -w rupa
```

Build a named project and the dependencies needed by it.

```bash
rbot -w release -- name=rupa
cd ../ruka && rbot -w clean
```

Release a single project (see [Releases](releases.md)); `clean` works per
project root like build.

## Dependencies

A project can declare another workspace project as a dependency:

```text
ruka.depends_on = rupamod
```

This is intended to make project ordering explicit while keeping each project independently buildable.

## Library-first builds

Workspace projects can be configured to produce libraries before final binaries. This is useful when multiple projects depend on each other's libraries or when the workspace has a two-stage relationship between libraries and executables.

The important model is:

1. establish required libraries;
2. link the final binaries once their library dependencies exist.

This avoids forcing users to manually orchestrate intermediate library builds.

Cross-project library references (`<n>.library.<os> = <project>`) resolve to
the other project's library artifact. Cyclic references (`rupa <-> ruka`) are
allowed: the two-phase build resolves them, and selective builds pull the
referenced projects transitively.

### cdeps — compile-time dependencies in one key

When a project consumes another project's headers **and** its library, the
per-OS spellings add up. `cdeps` replaces them with a single key:

```text
# before
ruka.headers = ../rupa/include
rukalib.linux = rupa
rukalib.macos = rupa
rukalib.windows = rupa

# after
ruka.cdeps = rupa
```

Synthesis expands `cdeps` internally into the dependency's library artifact
(`library = ../rupa/lib/librupa.a`) and its public include folders (the
folders the dependency itself declares as `headers`; `include` by default).
`cdeps` cycles are allowed exactly like `library.<os>` cycles — the two-phase
build resolves them — and selective builds (`-w <name>`) pull `cdeps`
projects transitively. The expanded lines win over nothing: any explicit
`headers`/`library` you also write stays valid and is not duplicated.

Packaging a project's files can reference another project's build outputs;
such path references become build dependencies automatically.

## Releases

A workspace can also declare distribution units — see
[Releases](releases.md). In short: `releases = ...` names the projects whose
artifacts get packaged into the workspace-level `dist/release/`, and
`rbot -w release -- name=<project>` packages a release straight from the CLI.
